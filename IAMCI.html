        <b>Position:</b> Composites Research and Characterization Engineer
        <br>
        <b>Manager:</b> Dr. Benjamin Denos
        <br>
        <b>Abstract:</b> Volkswagen and IDI Composites led a research project to create a prototype liftgate through sheet molding
        compound. As part of Purdue’s Composite Manufacturing and Simulation Center, I was primarily responsible for the
        project’s large-scale material characterization and aiding with design and material flow simulation. During the course
        of this industry-driven project, I performed a wide range of material characterization tests at different temperatures,
        along with their data analyses. I lead the operational process workflow of sample design, manufacturing, testing,
        characterization as well as data analysis and reporting of results.

            <b>Brief Summary</b>
            <ul id="summary">
                <li>Designed and manufactured over 500 test specimens from various Sheet Molded Compound (SMC) Glass-Fiber composite
                    plates prepared by IDI Composites</li>
                <li>Tested samples under tensile and 4-point loading at ambient, 90°C and -35°C temperatures and 3-point loading at
                    ambient temperature</li>
                <li>Carried out Digital Imaging Correlation (DIC) to retrieve stress-strain, load-displacement, heat transfer and
                    fracture data and Vic-3D software</li>
                <li>Performed Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) testing of samples using a similar DIC mechanism</li>
                <li>Performed data analysis and visualization with the help of MATLAB software - created global testing and
                    characterization MATLAB code to carry out analysis with reduced downtime and efficient user-customization</li>
                <li>Documented failure modes of tested samples through failure analysis</li>
                <li>Performed optical microscopy of sample cross-sections to measure fiber orientation to study manufacturing effects on material flow</li>
                <li>Aided with material flow and finite element simulation with the help of ABAQUS, utilizing the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) feature</li>
            </ul>
