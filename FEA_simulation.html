        <b>Abstract:</b> Honda Aircraft Company’s HA-420 HondaJet is a lightweight, twin-engine, six-seat business jet, having its first flight in 2014. The CEO of Honda Aircraft Company, Michimasa Fujino, decided that he wanted his company to come out with a breakthrough in not only the small and elite business jet market, but in the field of aeronautical engineering as a whole. Along with implementing several effective practices, like Natural Laminar Flow, composite fuselage and an extensive marketing strategy, one of the company’s most revolutionary breakthroughs is the Over-The-Wing-Engine-Design. Just like it sounds, unlike other jets or aircraft, this one has its engine mounted on top of the wing. It was proven through research papers that this design reduced drag, produced more life, and eventually proved to me more effective. The research papers that support these claims are all available on the website of Honda Aircraft Company.

            <b>I.  Problem Statement</b>
            Before creating a design on ABAQUS and performing simulations, we must look at the important aspects of the wing
            beforehand. To begin with, the airfoil that HA-420 HondaJet represents is that of <b>SHM-1</b>, specifically developed to
            support the load of the engine. The design in this report follows the airfoil design closely.
            The wing is purely made of <b>Aluminum</b>. Following are the important characteristics of the wing which are used in the
            design, simulation as well as analytical solution:
            <br>
            Next, we will analyze the ABAQUS design. Due to the simplification of the problem statement and lack of availability of certain important information, the design of the wing is simplified. The design consists of the following parts:

            <b>II.  FE Model</b>
            SOLIDWORKS Simulation offers tools that can help you test your designs and determine how to best enhance the quality of your products. In order to perform effective stress analysis, designers need to know not only the SOLIDWORKS Simulation user interface, but also the methodology and application of finite element analysis (FEA) in general. This course introduces how to set up a model for FEA analysis, run the analysis, and interpret the results to optimize your SOLIDWORKS models. Upon completing this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to carry out FEA with confidence.

            <b>III.  DYNAMIC ANALYSIS</b>
            Learn how to perform dynamic analysis using SOLIDWORKS Simulation. The course starts by covering dynamics theory and normal modes analysis. Dynamic analysis concepts are covered, including damping, mass participation, modal methods, and direct methods. Next, transient analysis is explored, including modal transient response, direct transient response, and base motion in dynamic response. Then, frequency response analysis, followed by how to interpret results.
